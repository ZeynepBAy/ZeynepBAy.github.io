### Museum of Science, Boston Sustainability Museum Exhibit - Zero Emission Energy

We developed a mobile museum exhibit aimed at educating high school and middle school students about sustainability in engineering. The exhibit was interactive, cost-effective (under $100), and designed to fit on a tabletop. Through engaging games, we highlighted the efficiency of nuclear energy while destigmatizing it and compared it with wind and solar power. User feedback confirmed the success of our approach, with visitors rating their experience 9.125 out of 10 and 87.5% correctly identifying nuclear energy as the most efficient. These results validated our goals of interactivity and education, effectively addressing the client's requirements and providing students with an engaging platform to understand sustainability concepts. Project was modeled initially in Autocad and SolidWorks, GUI was created in Matlab App Designer.

### Comparative Analysis of OTEC Systems with Nuclear and Fossil Fuels: A Sustainable Energy Approach


A comprehensive analysis of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) as a viable and environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional energy sources, such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The study focuses on the unique advantages of OTEC, particularly for a medium-sized population, and highlights its potential benefits beyond green energy production, including freshwater generation. Furthermore, the paper explores various modifications that can optimize the efficiency of the OTEC cycle, enhancing its overall performance and economic feasibility. The OTEC system was modeled and simulated in AspenPlus.
